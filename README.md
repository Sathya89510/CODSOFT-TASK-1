# CODSOFT-TASK-1
TITANIC SURVIVAL PREDICTION
# Titanic Survival Prediction

A machine learning project to predict passenger survival on the Titanic.

## Project Description
This project uses the classic Titanic dataset to build a predictive model that determines whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster based on various features like age, gender, ticket class, etc.

## Repository Structure
- `data/`: Contains the Titanic dataset
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for exploratory analysis
- `src/`: Python scripts for model training
- `output/`: Saved models and prediction results
- `reports/`: Project documentation and report

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repository
2. Install requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the Jupyter notebook or Python scripts

## Dataset
The dataset can be downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data)

## Results
Model achieved XX% accuracy (see report for details)
